# Outspoken Quote Library

This is one of my personal projects. It is a web app which serves to distribute thoughts and knowledge of well-known people. Quotes can be filtered by name and tags, and people are sorted alphabetically on the "A to Z" page. Quick technical facts about the project:

- The project is built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to retrieve data from a JSON file I created, which is hosted at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
- [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) is used to navigate between pages.
- The app was deployed with gh-pages. More information on the process can be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/outspoken.git
